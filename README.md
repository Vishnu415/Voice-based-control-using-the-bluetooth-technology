# Voice-based-control-using-the-bluetooth-technology
The aim of this project is to provide an efficient solution for control of electrical loads by voice using Bluetooth technology. Now a dayâ€™s technology is running with time, it completely occupied the life style of human beings. Even though there is such an importance for technology in our routine life there are even people whose life styles are very far to this well known term technology. So it is our responsibility to design few reliable systems which can be even efficiently used by them. This basic idea gave birth to the project control systems by voice command. Here the process is done through the micro controller and Bluetooth based technology.
